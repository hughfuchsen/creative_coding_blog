<font size="8">m</font><font size="5">y strengths lie in making melodies over musical chord progressions. singing melodies is a form of catharsis for me that i would absolutely go off the rails without. a biproduct of singing in order to relax is that i have developed a taste for the tone and form of melodies that could inform what is being communicated through music. of course, this is entirely subjective, but it fuels my creative drive to compose both lyrical folk music and instrumental video game soundtracks.

**some of my favourite singers:**
- _ aldous harding
- _ ella fitzgerald
- _ buck owens
- _ sarah vaughan
- _ chet baker
- _ deep forest (weird forest nymph voice)
- _ paul mccartney
- _ bjork
- _ mason ramsay (yodeling walmart kid)

> "the only thing better than singing is more singing." - ella fitzgerald

**some of my favourite video game sountracks:**
- _ super mario sixty-four
- _ all of the games mentioned in my 'introduction to two-dimensional worlds' blog

**adaptive soundtrack aspirations**
videogames with adaptive soundtracks have always fascinated me, so i love doing the same thing with my own music. something as simple as adding a drumbeat onto the song when you enter a new area in the game is so effective in utilising the same song, yet presenting a whole extra layer of art direction. the two soundcloud tracks are examples of an adaptive soundtrack i am working on. 

the challenge for me is figuring out a way to program this into my game designs, as i am yet to do it.

<font size="8">a</font><font size="5">s a small child, i always enjoyed sitting in awe over my older brother's shoulder while he figured out how to play <span style="color:skyblue">*super mario land two: six golden coins*</span> on his recently acquired, <span style="color:red">*nintendo gambeboy*.</span> 
my mind - along with the minds of many of other youngins - was completely blown by the beautiful and evocative art of video game design. growing up in a farming family as the youngest of four, the concept of an entire world being programmed behind a pixelated screen the size of my mum's nursing pager was often met with belittlement as i was sent outside to fix the cattle-troph leak for the thirteenth time that summer.

i remained hooked on these digital fantasies... 
on the condition that i would attend pony club, i told my mum that i wanted to buy a <span style="color:blue">*gameboy advance sp*</span> with the money i had saved. i would go hide in the horse float during show-jumping meets playing <span style="color:skyblue">*yoshi's island*</span> for as long as i could until i was caught out. apart from the hurt i felt when my passion for these activities was subtly shunned by my parents, am thankful for my upbringing in 'reality', as it informs the stories i am inspired to pass on when designing my own digital worlds. my embrace of what was thought of as mere 'escapism' rendered a soft-spot in my heart for video games, especially for those in the style of two dimensions.

i am immensely grateful to have experienced a versatile first twenty-eight years of my three-dimensional life that helps cultivate my inspiration for designing two-dimensional games: 

**open world adventures**
- _ frequently travelling through the united states, touring with music and visiting family
- _ visiting japan as much as i can
- _ (<span style="color:green">*the legend of zelda: a link to the past*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:#FFC000">*pokemon yellow*</span>) 
- _ (<span style="color:skyblue">*hyper light drifter*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:red">*piku niku*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:pink">*untitled goose*<span>)

**farming** 
- _ raising cattle
- _ fixing stuff
- _ planting a lot of native trees
- _ shovelling and chopping stuff
- _ etc
- _ (<span style="color:green">*stardew valley*</span>)

**running a family bed and breakfast** 
- _ cleaning
- _ relationships with new people all the time
- _ (<span style="color:orange">*the sims*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:blue">*animal crossing*</span>)

- _ the list elaborates and goes on.

by reading the above list, one can correctly assume that i have cultivated an affinity for isometric art. isometric art is a drawing or illustration style that makes two-dimensional figures appear three dimensional. in three dimensional game designs such as <span style="color:pink">*untitled goose*</span>, <span style="color:orange">*the sims*</span> and <span style="color:blue">*animal crossing*</span>, the concept of isometric art remains, as any point-perspective in the three-d art is eliminated. growing up with limited access to video games, i started out just (mostly) playing old-school titles that did not belong to three-d platforms like the <span style="color:red">*nintendo sixty-four*</span>. as much as i love and appreciate playing three-d games, my current drive to create isometric worlds comes from this limitation that i was presented with as a smaller boy. 

so that is a glimpse of the seed that germinated into my passion for the gargantuan pursuit of game design. ◡̈
