<font size="8">a</font><font size="5">s a small child, i always enjoyed sitting in awe over my older brother's shoulder while he figured out how to play <span style="color:skyblue">*super mario land two: six golden coins*</span> on his recently acquired, <span style="color:red">*nintendo gambeboy*.</span> 
my mind - along with the minds of many of other youngins - was completely blown by the beautiful and evocative art of video game design. growing up in a farming family as the youngest of four, the concept of an entire world being programmed behind a pixelated screen the size of my mum's nursing pager was often met with belittlement as i was sent outside to fix the cattle-troph leak for the thirteenth time that summer.

i remained hooked on these digital fantasies... 
on the condition that i would attend pony club, i told my mum that i wanted to buy a <span style="color:blue">*gameboy advance sp*</span> with the money i had saved. i would go hide in the horse float during show-jumping meets playing <span style="color:skyblue">*yoshi's island*</span> for as long as i could until i was caught out. apart from the hurt i felt when my passion for these activities was subtly shunned by my parents, am thankful for my upbringing in 'reality', as it informs the stories i am inspired to pass on when designing my own digital worlds. my embrace of what was thought of as mere 'escapism' rendered a soft-spot in my heart for video games, especially for those in the style of two dimensions.

i am immensely grateful to have experienced a versatile first twenty-eight years of my three-dimensional life that helps cultivate my inspiration for designing two-dimensional games: 

**open world adventures**
- _ frequently travelling through the united states, touring with music and visiting family
- _ visiting japan as much as i can
- _ (<span style="color:green">*the legend of zelda: a link to the past*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:#FFC000">*pokemon yellow*</span>) 
- _ (<span style="color:skyblue">*hyper light drifter*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:red">*piku niku*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:pink">*untitled goose*<span>)

**farming** 
- _ raising cattle
- _ fixing stuff
- _ planting a lot of native trees
- _ shovelling and chopping stuff
- _ etc
- _ (<span style="color:green">*stardew valley*</span>)

**running a family bed and breakfast** 
- _ cleaning
- _ relationships with new people all the time
- _ (<span style="color:orange">*the sims*</span>)
- _ (<span style="color:blue">*animal crossing*</span>)

- _ the list elaborates and goes on.

by reading the above list, one can correctly assume that i have cultivated an affinity for isometric art. isometric art is a drawing or illustration style that makes two-dimensional figures appear three dimensional. in three dimensional game designs such as <span style="color:pink">*untitled goose*</span>, <span style="color:orange">*the sims*</span> and <span style="color:blue">*animal crossing*</span>, the concept of isometric art remains, as any point-perspective in the three-d art is eliminated. growing up with limited access to video games, i started out just (mostly) playing old-school titles that did not belong to three-d platforms like the <span style="color:red">*nintendo sixty-four*</span>. as much as i love and appreciate playing three-d games, my current drive to create isometric worlds comes from this limitation that i was presented with as a smaller boy. 

so that is a glimpse of the seed that germinated into my passion for the gargantuan pursuit of game design. ◡̈
