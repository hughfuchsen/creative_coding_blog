# my intoduction to two-dimensional worlds
--- 
as a small child, i always enjoyed sitting in awe over my older brother's shoulder while he figured out how to play *super mario land two: six golden coins* on his recently acquired, *nintendo gambeboy*. my mind - along with the minds of many of other youngins - was completely blown by the beautiful and evocative art of video game design. growing up in a farming family as the youngest of four, the concept of an entire world being programmed behind a pixelated screen the size of my mum's nursing pager was often met with belittlement as i was sent outside to fix the cattle-troph leak for the thirteenth time that summer.

i remained hooked on these digital fantasies... on the condition that i would attend pony club, i told my mum that i wanted to buy a *gameboy advance sp* with the money i had saved. i would go hide in the horse float during show-jumping meets playing *yoshi's island* for as long as i could until i was caught out. apart from the hurt i felt when my passion for these activities was subtly shunned by my parents, am thankful for my upbringing in 'reality', as it informs the stories i am inspired to pass on when designing my own digital worlds. my embrace of what was thought of as mere 'escapism' rendered a soft-spot in my heart for video games, especially for those in the style of two dimensions.

i am immensely grateful to have experienced a versatile first twenty-eight years of my three-dimensional life that helps cultivate my inspiration for designing two-dimensional games: 

**open world adventures**
- frequently travelling through the united states, touring with music and visiting family
- visiting japan as much as i can
- (*the legend of zelda: a link to the past*)
- (*pokemon yellow*) 
- (*hyper light drifter*)
- (*piku niku*)
- (*untitled goose*)

**farming** 
- raising cattle
- fixing stuff
- planting a lot of native trees
- shovelling and chopping stuff
- etc
- (*stardew valley*)

**running a family bed and breakfast** 
- cleaning
- relationships with new people all the time
- (*the sims*)
- (*animal crossing*)

- the list elaborates and goes on.

by reading the above list, one can correctly assume that i have cultivated an affinity for isometric art. isometric art is a drawing or illustration style that makes two-dimensional figures appear three dimensional. in a three dimensional game design such as *untitled goose*, *the sims* and *animal crossing*, the concept of isometric art remains, as any point-perspective in the three-d art is eliminated. growing up with limited access to video games, i started out just (mostly) playing old-school titles that did not belong to three-d platforms like the *nintendo sixty-four*. as much as i love and appreciate playing three-d games, my current drive to create isometric worlds comes from this limitation that i was presented with as a smaller boy. 

so that is a glimpse of seed that germinated into my passion for the gargantuan pursuit of game design. :joy:
